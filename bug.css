The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not produce the expected result if the parent element doesn't have a defined width. Another issue can arise from using nested `calc()` functions, where the browser might interpret the calculations in an unexpected order or encounter issues with operator precedence.  Also, the units in `calc()` must be consistent, mixing different units without proper conversion can lead to errors.
